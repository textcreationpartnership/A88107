            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The ſecond <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is that of the Parliament and Citie; whereof we have had ſuch happy experience, ever ſince the unhappy hoſtility betwixt the flatterers of the King, and friends of the Kingdome, that

            <p>A fourth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is betwixt the Aſſembly of Divines and the City Miniſters; who may the more eaſily accord and agree together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of them be but the ſame men under ſeverall relations; and moſt of them are ſwaid by the ſame principles of truth and pietie, and involved in a ſociety and participation of the ſame duties, hopes, and hazards.</p>
            <p>The fifth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is betwixt the City Magiſtracie and the Citie Miniſtery, to which both ingenuous, and religious correſpondence doth diſpoſe them; for no where in the Proteſtant Churches (ſo farre as I have read or received by report) are good Miniſters better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, or more reſpectively uſed, then in this City, nor by any Citizens more then by thoſe who are moſt worthy of honour; and is cannot but be the deſire, as well as the duty, of godly Miniſters, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them as much as may be in the eſtimation of the people; and to preſſe upon them obedience according to their duty, and dependence, for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>And though it be obvious to common obſervation, how much the Magiſtrates favour maketh for the Miniſters honour, and ſuccour, it is not unknowne, nor unobſerved by the wiſe, that the Miniſters have been very ſerviceable to the Civill State, and to the Military too, <hi>not onely by their ſupplications</hi> to God, for good ſucceſſe to all their publique undertakings, and their happy proceedings in all their warlike marches, and motions, as at the removall of the Arke. <hi>Numb. 10.35.

               <p>For the <hi>firſt;</hi> he ſaith it is <hi>at this time ſeaſonably to be conſidered.</hi> So it is, now it is publiſhed; but it was very <hi>unſeaſonably</hi> offered: and I marvell that he, who hath written a whole booke of <hi>policy,</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>unpoliticke</hi> as to thinke it <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> to ſet forth ſuch a <hi>Quere,</hi> and ſo to reſolve it; ſuch it tends to retard the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Government, whereto the Parliament is ſo much enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not onely for the thing it ſelfe, but for a timely propoſition, and impoſition of it by their civill ſanction.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>firſt, that they intend to ſet up a Church government,</hi> we have it, 1. From their expreſſe profeſſion, <hi>December</hi> 15. 1641. <hi>We doe here declare, that it is farre from our purpoſe or deſire to let looſe the golden reines of Diſcipline, and Government in the Church, to leave private perſons, or particular Congregations to take up what forme of ſervice they pleaſe; for we hold it requiſite, that there ſhould be throughout the whole Realme a conformitie in that order, which the Lawes enioyne according to the word of God.</hi> So in the firſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance</hi> of the Honourable Houſe of Commons. <hi>pag.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. from the firſt Article of the <hi>ſolemne League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> publiſhed by Authoritie of Parliament, <hi>September</hi> 21. 1643. Wherein they, and all others that take it, doe covenant <hi>to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the reformation of Religion in the Kingdomes of England and Ireland, in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God, and the example of the beſt reformed Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. this Covenant was ordered againe by the Honorable Houſe of Commons, <hi>Januarie</hi> 29. 1644. to be publiquely read every Faſt day, and to be ſet up in every Congregation in a faire Table, where every one may read it; and to this are ſet the names of <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> and 243. more of the <hi>Honourable Houſe of Commons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the <hi>ſecond,</hi> that they meane to <hi>expedite</hi> the ſettling of Government with all convenient ſpeed, we have good cauſe to conceive.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they have beſtowed already very many dayes in conſultation about it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113330:10"/>2. They inſiſt in the ſame conſultations ſtill.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They (according to the eminence of their wiſdome) appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend many and great evils, that grow both in number, and power, by Doctrines of Libertiniſme, which neceſſarily require the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of a reformed Church Government.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They have already ſet it up.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In their <hi>Ordinance of Ordination,</hi> ſet forth the laſt yeare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In an <hi>Ordinance for making London a Province</hi> this laſt yeare, dividing it into ſeverall <hi>Claſſes,</hi> and for chooſing a Committee for tryall of <hi>Elders</hi> to be choſen, and <hi>Rules</hi> to be obſerved for orderly proceeding in the ſame; and this before this <hi>Quere</hi> came forth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since that, they have advanced further, by a <hi>Vote and Order for chooſing Elders</hi> forthwith in particular Congregations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſt of all, they have publiſhed an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> with <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>directions for ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament,</hi> in caſes of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Scandall.</p>
               <p>Yet they cannot make that ſpeed with the Government, which by moſt is deſired, and very much deſired by themſelves (as we of the Aſſembly can witneſſe, who have often beene ſent to by that <hi>Honourable Senate</hi> to quicken our worke, and to ripen our debates to a full reſolution) becauſe as with us the libertie of ſpeaking (wherein every one is free to propoſe, and proſecute any doubt) prolonged the Government in our hands; ſo the like libertie in the Honourable Houſes (or rather our libertie is like theirs, it being the <hi>Prototypon</hi>) lengthens the debates, and delayes the Votes of that moſt Honourable Senate; and ſo much the more, becauſe they are more in number then we in our Synod; and becauſe their determinations are finall, as ours are not.</p>
               <p>And though that which is publiſhed doe not yet reach home to our full ſatisfaction, we hope it is in the way towards further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which cannot reaſonably be expected in the firſt Eſſayes of frames, and formes of Government; for we may ſay of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> as well as of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was not built in a day, though in time it became <hi>the perfection of beautie, the ioy of the whole earth, Lam.</hi> 2.15.

                  <hi>The other particular</hi> he propounds to make his <hi>Quere</hi> more plauſible, is the reference it hath to two precious things, viz. <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> both which are upheld by Government, Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and without it, for <hi>truth</hi> we have abundance of <hi>errours,</hi> and <hi>hereſies</hi> broached among us, which divide men into manifold Sects and Factions; and where they are multiplied, there can be no <hi>peace,</hi> without a treacherous toleration, which will reſolve at laſt into an Anarchy and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed this, he putteth his <hi>Quere</hi> thus.</p>
               <q>Whether it be fit according to the Principles of true Religion, and State, to ſettle any Church-government over the Kingdome haſtily, or not; and with the power commonly deſired, in the hands of the Miniſters.</q>
               <p>Firſt, he putteth the caſe <hi>according to the Principles of Religion, and State:</hi> which if he had well conſidered, he might have thought the Parliament for the one, and the Aſſembly of Divines for the other, (competently qualified, each in their profeſſion, for reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a doubt, eſpecially ſince it is a chiefe part of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worke of them both, to drive it to its iſſue) might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſuch a <hi>Quere</hi> as this, from a private Divine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſuggeſts a ſuſpition, as if the Parliament were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the Diſcipline and Government of the Church in <hi>Jehu's</hi> Chariot, with furious haſte, whereas both Parliament, and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have much adoe, to ward off imputations of procraſtination, and delay; for debating ſo long, and determining ſo little, whereof we have rendred the reaſons before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he preſents it as a <hi>gravamen,</hi> or of ſome dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that the power ſhould be put in the hands of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whereas Miniſters put in for no more power as their due, either from the Magiſtrate, or over the people, then is conſonant to the Scripture, and the principles of prudence; and if leſſe then that be allowed them, ſince it is from God, and for God, not for themſelves, God rather then they will be unworthily dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and if it <hi>be commonly deſired,</hi> (as he ſaith) it is the leſſe liable to his, or any mans exception.</p>

I will propound his owne words, <hi>The rules laid downe in the word for practicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are
<note n="*" place="margin">§ 1. p. 3.</note> theſe in part, Let every one be fully perſwaded in his owne mind,</hi> Rom. 14.5. and, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> verſ. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the ſetling of any government upon a people who are yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally untaught in the nature and grounds of it, is to put upon them the practice of that wherein it is impoſſible they can be perſwaded in their minde, and ſo either on a neceſſity of ſinne, or miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>S.</hi> had minded, as he ought, what he was to prove, he ſhould have planted his reaſon directly againſt <hi>the enioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or impoſing of a Government, rather then againſt obedience to it;</hi> and ſo the Scriptures alleadged ſhould have beene made <hi>remoraes</hi> to the erecting of a government, thus:</p>
               <p>Thoſe that ſet up a government <hi>whereof they are not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded im their mind,</hi> and which they <hi>cannot doe in faith, doe ſinne.</hi> But they that now ſet up a Church government, with power <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deſired in the hands of Miniſters,</hi> doe ſet up a government <hi>whereof they are not fully perſwaded in their minds;</hi> Therefore in ſo doing they ſinne.</p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> propoſition hath warrant from the forecited places; but the <hi>minor</hi> is that wherein the weight or weakneſſe of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument doth conſiſt; and that cannot be proved, nor can, without breach of charitie, be ſuppoſed of ſuch as have taken ſo long time, made uſe of ſo many learned and faithfull Counſellours (diſcuſſing and reſolving all points of difficultie by the Scripture) to be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded both in <hi>conſcience,</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> for what they ſet forth, touching the government of the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we take this reaſon to ſtand immediately againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and conſequently againſt commands or impoſitions, it will be ſomewhat more formall, but every whit as feeble, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereof every one</hi> (under governement) <hi>cannot be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his own mind, and whereto he cannot yeeld <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> obedience of faith,</hi> may not be ſet up or ſetled in the Church.</p>
               <p>But of the government of the Church, with the power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deſired, every one under government <hi>cannot be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113330:13"/>in his mind,</hi> nor ſubmit to it of faith; And therefore it may not be ſet up, or cannot at all be ſet up without ſinne.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition granted, the <hi>Maior</hi> muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: For it is flatly repugnant to religion and reaſon, and makes as much againſt the former Proteſtations of the Parliament, and the late Covenant of three Kingdomes; yea againſt all aſſurances of either kind, as againſt the Government in queſtion; for there will be alwayes ſome that will be ſcrupled with any thing that is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But ſaith he,
<note n="*" place="margin">§ 1. p. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The people are generally unt aught in the nature, and grounds of this Church Government;</hi> and therefore to <hi>put upon them the practice of that whereof it is impoſſible they can be fully perſwaded in their minds,</hi> is to put them <hi>upon a neceſſitie either of ſinne or of miſery;</hi> To which,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is ſo eaſie and ready, that it may be ſome matter of marvaile an ingenious man (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> is) ſhould make ſuch an Objection; for</p>

               <p n="2">2. For what is of leſſe moment, if it be not directly deduced out of Scripture, it is not repugnant to the Scripture, but agreeable to grounds of prudence, and the example of the beſt reformed Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the practice of Government, it belongeth not to the peoples part (as he puts the caſe), to be active in it; but to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Elders, and they are not to enter upon the exerciſe of their authoritie before they be ſufficiently informed in it: and thence it is that (though there be an Order given for it): they that ſhould officiate in it make a pauſe, and deliberate upon it, before they ſet upon the practiſe of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the people, ſo farre as concerneth their compliance or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the government, they are to be inſtructed in it before they yeeld ſubmiſſion to it; for that purpoſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is propoſed by parts, and by degrees, ſo as it may be beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by all; and the Preachers appointed to teach both the offices of the Gevernours, and the duties of the people, ſo as each may performe his part without ſcruple, or doubting.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">§. 5. p. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>We have found by experience that the ſpeedy ſetling of Government upon a Nation, hath made reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take little root, ſave in the outward man,</hi> or <hi>formall obedience; becauſe they received not reformation in the power of the word; but of the State, which went not ſo deepe into the conſcience but they could part with it at any time upon a Law:</hi> And he concludes his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a patheticall interrogation: <hi>O then why doe not dayes ſpeake, and multitude of yeares teach knowledge?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this may be replyed:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if he meane it in reſpect of our owne Kingdome (and that experience is moſt like to come within his cognizance) the fault was not in the over-ſpeedy ſetling of a Government, but in the choyce of a wrong Government: <hi>viz.</hi> that of Prelacy, which by an Act and Ordinance of Parliament, and by the Nationall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is cryed downe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If when Diſcipline is eſtabliſhed, Doctrine were aboliſhed, or for a time ſuſpended and ſilenced, there were ſome force in this exception of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Saltmarſh;</hi> but Doctrine goeth on where Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline cometh in; as a Schoole maſter is at the ſame time in Office both a teacher, and a corrector of his ſchollers; and ſo the power of the word may go deep into the conſcience, and the Diſcipline or Government is rather an helpe, then an hindrance to that opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Diſcipline or Government is as an hedge or wall about the Doctrine of Religion; a goad or ſpurre to the meanes of grace, to bring men under the power of the Words operation; a curbe to licentious courſes; all which conduce much to the <hi>keeping of the conſcience voyd of offence toward God and man:</hi> and though with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113330:15"/>many the reformation reach no further then the outward man, <hi>yet that</hi> is not to be imputed to the Diſcipline which brings them to the Word, but to their owne corruptions, and Satans ſleights, and deceits which hinder the Words kindly and ſaving worke upon them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where the Diſcipline hath beene rightly choſen, and timely eſtabliſhed, God hath bleſſed it with better fruits; as in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Scotland;</hi> whence it is that that Church hath had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and honour from God, to <hi>be free both from hereſie and ſchiſme,</hi> where with we of this Kingdome and State have abounded ſo much the more, as the Diſcipline bath beene the more delayed; which agreoth to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his politick obſervation in theſe words:

                  <p n="1">1. Here he argueth from the example of the New Teſtament <hi>negatively;</hi> which, (conſidering the difference and diſproportion of the times) is very impertinent. For the converſion we read of in the New Teſtament was from <hi>Paganiſme</hi> and <hi>Judaiſme</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianitie;</hi> and while men were Iewes or Pagans, they were uncapable of a Chriſtian Government; our Congregations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> conſiſt of profeſſed Chriſtians; who, as ſuch, are capable of, and lyable to a Goſpel Government, without which the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, the preaching of the Word cannot be well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, nor either of the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p>And though in thouſands of Congregations there be many whom the power of the Word and Spirit hath not brought to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel obedience, it is no cauſe why a Goſpel Government ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113330:16"/>not be eſtabliſhed over them; nay rather it is reaſon why it ſhould be haſtened upon them; and we may impute the profaneneſſe of the people to the want of it, or of ſome parts of it, whereby Church Governours may be enabled to <hi>put a difference betwixt the holy and the profane, the uncleane and the cleane,</hi> Ezek. 22.26. For the <hi>rod of Diſcipline,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.21. may have a ſalutary operation in the Church, as the <hi>rod of correction</hi> in the family, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.13, 14.</p>

<note place="margin">See § 11.</note> 
                     <hi>as in the materiall building ſtone and timber are not to be clapt together without hewing, and ſquaring, ſo not in the ſpirituall;</hi> of which words (if I rightly underſtand them) the meaning is, that Churches muſt be gathered and made up onely of holy, reformed Chriſtians, which are as hewen or ſquared ſtones; to which I anſwer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſimilitudes may illuſtrate a truth proved, or to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but they prove nothing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That conformity betwixt materiall and ſpirituall things is not to be carried too far; ſimilitudes, (as the common ſaying is) run not on foure feet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is this difference betwixt the building of the ſpirituall and <hi>material</hi> Temple, that in the ſpiritual there is nothing but what is homogencall, and of one kind, all ſquared and living ſtones, but in the <hi>materiall</hi> the foundation and walls are made up not onely of hewen and ſquared ſtones, but of others, yea many pieces of ſtone which are but as rubbiſh, have their uſe in the materiall building.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And yet wee may ſay of thoſe whom hee accounts rough and unhewen ſtones, that they are in part ſquared towards a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the reſt of the building (in that they ſubmit to the Goſpell rule in many particulars) though they be not ſo exactly ſquared, or ſo perfectly poliſhed as others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Vpon this difference the beſt ſtones are not to be taken from the reſt to make up a building by themſelves, as in ſeparated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations many pretend, but performe not; for of thoſe who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from others as from profane perſons, divers are not onely rather <hi>gilded</hi> Hypocrites then golden Chriſtians; but they are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of them ſuch as for want of charity and humility Chriſt would not owne for his diſciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.35. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. and who for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113330:16"/>railing and covetouſneſſe, and other raigning ſinnes of an haynons guilt ought to be diſcarded from Chriſtian ſociety, as well as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, a drunkard, or an idolator, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To conclude with a Negative Argument from the Now Teſtament, as he began his fourth Paragraph, (and againſt him it is good Logick, as an Apocryphall Text is good proofe againſt a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.) Let him ſhew any example of ſuch a ſeparation as he aymes at, in the New Teſtament; where when there was a mixture of holy and prophane, (as there was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21.) the Apoſtles, or Evangelicall perſons, gathered out the holy part to make a ſeparated Church from the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That which followeth, concerning Axes and Hammers not heard in the building of the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> hath a myſterious truth in it, but not to the purpoſe for which he produceth it; for it importeth that the ſpirituall Temple is built up chiefly by the ſoft whiſperings and ſecret motions of the Spirit; whereof men heare no noyſe, nor can take notice; and what is this to what hee would have?</p>

But we ſee the contrary, firſt in himſelfe, he taught long, and Iohn before him, and ſo the Diſciples, and the gifts for Government were not given till he aſcended, and the modell for Government was not brought forth but by degrees, and as people fell in, and were capable of the yoke, and would mould more eaſily to the Commandements of Chriſt; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then or no, is yet a Queſtion (which ſome have ſit the debates to) though not with me, who am fully perſwaded of the power of order which the Apoſtle ioyed to behold; though a power with as little do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in government, as tradition in worſhip.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The acts and times for the Divine providence towards his Church are various; and the reaſons of them many times reſerved to God: he could, no doubt, have governed his Church in the firſt age of the world, by the ſcepter of his written word, but there was no Scripture till God wrote his Decalogue or ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements in Tables of ſtone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.18. and if the Booke of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> were written before, it was yet after the birth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (for he was the Penman of it) who was not borne till the yeare of the world, 2373. all this while God had his Church, and no written Law for the government of it. <hi>Yet</hi> when he brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (which was in the yeare, 2454) the next yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he gave direction for the building of a Tabernacle; and to the <hi>Morall</hi> Law forementioned added Lawes <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> and <hi>Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall;</hi> divers of which were not to be put in execution untill their coming into <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was well neere fortie yeares after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſo farre was he before-hand with the government of his Church of the new edition.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:113330:20"/>2. Whereas he ſaith, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt could have as eaſily ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the government</hi> of his Church <hi>by miracle, as any can now by Civill power;</hi> we grant it, yea and more, that he could have done it without a miracle; and yet more, that he did ſo, when he choſe Apoſtles and gave them the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. for remiſſion and retaining of ſinnes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.23. and ſet downe a rule of graduall proceeding with offenders, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be ſaid, that this was late in the Miniſtery of our Saviour, and therefore we muſt take his example, not onely for the thing it ſelfe, but for the time; this will make more for the Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall delay of Baptiſme, then for delay in Diſcipline or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for he was not baptized untill he was about thirty yeares of age, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.23. but he began to ſet up a government of his Church within the compaſſe of his publique Miniſtery, which at the moſt laſted but foure yeares ſpace, and many learned men confine it to three yeares and an halfe, or thereabouts. As for <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> his time was ſhorter, for he was beheaded in the ſecond of the foure yeares forementioned; nor did it belong to his Office to ſet up a government in the Evangelicall Church, but <hi>to prepare the way of the Lord</hi> by preaching repentance unto the people, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whereas he ſaith, <hi>the gifts of government were not given till Chriſt aſcended;</hi> to that it may be anſwered:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he aſcended fortie three dayes after the period of his publique Miniſtration, which added to the yeares forementioned, make but ſmall difference as to the government in queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That though he gave them an increaſe of gifts for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he did for preaching, he put his Apoſtles upon neither of thoſe offices without competent gifts, and qualifications for them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the <hi>model</hi> of government, which he ſaith was <hi>brought forth by degrees, as people fell in and were capable of the yoke;</hi> I would know what model he meaneth; if he meane any model of Chriſt or his Apoſtles (as it appeareth he doth, for ſaith he, againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Colemans</hi> opinion, <hi>I am fully aſſured of a power of order, which the Apoſtle reioyced to behold,</hi> Col. 2.5.) I aske whether this be given by tradition, or contained in the Scripture; I ſuppoſe he will
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113330:20"/>ſay of Government (as well as of Worſhip) not by tradition, but by the written word; and if ſo, though it were but young in the time of Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, it is very ancient to us; (for we have no part of the written word but it is fifteene hundred yeares of age at leaſt) why then ſhould that which is ſo old in conſtitution, be thought too ſoone to be put in execution at the preſent? eſpecially ſince (beſides the direction for it in the Scripture) we have had theſe many yeares ſeverall patterns of it, in many reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Chriſtian world.</p>
                  <p>Nor doe our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> (though they aſſert it from Scripture to be the will of God) expect that the Parliament ſhould eſtabliſh it <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>

                  <p>Here he makes the Civill and Eccleſiaſticall State ſo linked, and neerely allied together, that if there be motions in the one, there will not be quietneſſe in the other; and that the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> State hath ſuch an intereſt in the Civill, that it is hazardous to the Civill part, if <hi>it</hi> be not allowed: and for that reaſon the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is tolerated in the Popiſh Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> which is as a pay or a recompence for their civill engagement. <hi>In which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> (as in divers others) he aimes at the <hi>perpetuall</hi> prohibition of Government; not at a <hi>temporall</hi> forbearance onely; and he carrieth it on ſo as if we muſt allow him the authoritie of a prolitique Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor without any proofe of Scripture, reaſon, yea or of any humane teſtimony; for what he ſaith, (though in the way of a rationall ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) hath ſo little ſtrength of reaſon in it, that it reacheth not halfe way to the reſolution of the Queſtion in the Tenour of his Tenet. For what if the Church and State be ſo ſymbolicall as to reciprocate intereſts, and conditions, betwixt themſelves? ſhall the Civill State leave every man, or every Congregation to their owne libertie to be governed, or ungoverned as they liſt? every man in matters of Religion to doe <hi>that which is right in his owne eyes,</hi> as when <hi>there was no King in Iſrael?</hi> ſudg. 17.6. Nay rather, becauſe diſturbances are communicated from the one to the other, the Civill State ought to ſettle the government of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, <hi>according to the word of God, and the example of the beſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches;</hi> that it may the more ſecurely enjoy its owne peace. And for that he ſaith of the toleration of the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> the originall of it was not out of any principle of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all Religions with the Civill State, but becauſe the King himſelfe <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth having beene a Proteſtant, and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his right by the Armes of Proteſtants, (though he wickedly revolted from his Religion, and wretchedly ſuffered for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie) he could doe no leſſe in humanity then allow them the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of Religion; <hi>which hath beene continued unto them</hi> not upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>S.</hi> his ground before mentioned, but becauſe the Proteſtants are the truſtieſt friends of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> and moſt enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to defend it againſt the intereſts, and deſignes of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whoſe longing after an univerſall Monarchy, is carried with the ſtrongeſt degree of concupiſcence towards the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:113330:22"/>as the fayreſt marke of his boundleſſe ambition. Now though his argument fall farre ſhort of probable, he concludes with aſſurance: <hi>Sure I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that State is moſt free where the conſcience is leaſt ſtraitned;</hi> If he meane moſt free in indulgence, by letting looſe the reigns to all Religions, it is true, and if he allow of ſuch a freeneſſe, (as by his enſuing words it ſeemes he doth) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth with the Authour of the Booke of the <hi>Bloody Tenet,</hi> who holdeth (as abſurdly as impiouſly) that <hi>it is the will and command of God that (ſince the coming of his Sonne the Lord Jeſus) a permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the moſt Paganiſh, Iewiſh, Turkiſh,

                  <p>Firſt, that poſſibility is but a poore plea againſt probability, nay, againſt particular experience; for it is obvious to any mans view that will obſerve the method of proceeding, and manner of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the diſſenting party, that while their brethren have endevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all amicable carriage towards them, and by courteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them, to worke and win them to a brotherly accord, they have driven on their owne deſigne with a politique activity,

                  <p>And in ſuch a caſe for any private man to obtrude himſelfe upon the Miniſter, is to act an arbitrary power upon him, yea an arbitrary tyranny if he ſhould be authoriſed ſo to doe: and ſhould it be ſo (out we have ſo much experience of the piety, prudence, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the moſt Honourable Houſes, that we can never ſuſpect any ſuch preſſure to proceed from them) we can readily reſolve to act, or to forbeare what according to the Dictate of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences we conceive to be enjoyned, or prohibited by our great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and to beare and ſuffer what ſhall be impoſed on us by our Superiours under him, to whom we profeſſe our obedience is due, (being but private perſons) either actively or paſſively, in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſhall determine concerning our perſons, liberties, and eſtates.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113330:34"/>rule, as Miniſters have; nor are like to have ſo many mouthes open to reprove, or reproach them for, or ſo many hands to reſtraine them from miſdoing, or to puniſh them for it, (as moſt Miniſters in regard of their poverty, and impotencie, for the moſt part may expect, which the Magiſtrates their ſuperiours in eſtate and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie need not ſo much to feare) there is no reaſon I conceive, to take all power of cenſure from the Presbyterie, for the Miniſters ſake (for the Elders are not denied to be capable of juriſdiction as they are members of the Civil State) and to put all upon the power, and vigilant and conſcionable execution of the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>And I doubt not but we may confidently averre, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of precedent and ſubſequent times will make it good, that it is ſo farre from being ſuperfluous that there be a concurrence of the Civill and Presbyteriall power for ſuppreſſion of ſinne, that when both are imployed and improved with all prudence, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and conſcience, to ſuppreſſe the corruption of nature, and to prevent the ſpreading and prevailing of ſcandalous ſins, and when the ſevere and ſtrict diſcipline of private Families, and of common Schooles is added unto them, there will be no cauſe, for all that, to ſuſpect any pleonaſme either of piety, or civilitie, among the people of the Kingdome.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, if he meant it concerning admiſſion to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, (which is that which hath beene moſt agitated betwixt him and ſome of our Tribe) the conteſtation on the Miniſters part is but for the libertie of their conſcience, the puritie of Gods Ordinance, the preventing of Scandall, which cauſeth and confirmeth Schiſme; and in ſuch caſes it becomes them not to be remiſſe, or to manage ſuch a Cauſe with a Laodicean luke warmeneſſe, but with ſervencie of ſpirit; and yet I doubt not, but their zeale therein, for the chiefeſt of them, is, and will be guided with knowledge, and both tempered with humility, modeſty, and meekneſſe of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And that it hath none affinitie with an affectation of power, or liberty to reject men from the Sacrament at their pleaſure, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve (becauſe I am confident it is the mind of moſt of thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who are competently qualified with knowledge, and grace for their holy function) that it is matter of great griefe of heart unto them to have any occaſion of ſending any of their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſad from the Sacrament, or (as it may be likely to prove in moſt caſes) with wrath, and heart-burning againſt themſelves. For my part I ever tooke it for one of the great aggrievances which many godly Miniſters (who were conformiſts in the geſture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lords Supper) ſuffered under the domination of the Biſhops, that they put it upon them to put ſuch from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as out of ſcruple of conſcience durſt not kneele at the receit of it; and that ſuch were threatned with ſuſpenſion (and ſome

And if I know mine owne heart in this point, I thinke it would be as great a trouble to me to be an agent, as to any man to be a patient in ſuch a repulſe; and as great a joy if any were able to cleare it unto my conſcience, that no part of that Government ought to be committed to my charge, which I ever apprehended as a burden, (and that an heavy one) rather then a priviledge.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. For the Aſſertion it ſelfe, there be two things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt: <hi>Whether the Aſſertion be true or no?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reſolution of this Queſtion muſt be made with difference of times; for Countreys, as well as particular perſons, have their variations in Religion, not onely for profeſſion of the faith, but for practiſe of holineſſe: as in King <hi>James</hi> his dayes, upon the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and libertie granted upon the Sunday, (that is the name in the Declaration, and it is the fitteſt name for a licence of profaneneſſe) for ſports and paſtimes, renewed by the King that now is, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> were more looſe and licentious on that day, then now they are, upon the burning of that Book, and an Ordinance of Parliament ſet out for the more holy obſervation of the Sabbath. The Application of this diſtinction may reſolve the obſervation ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall waies; and we may ſay, that ſometimes one people or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes another, (and the ſame people at one time more then at another) may be more conformable in practiſe to the principles of piety.</p>
                  <p>And as there is a diſtinction of times, ſo of places; ſome are more, ſome leſſe civilized; as in <hi>Scotland
<note n="*" place="margin">Abbot <hi>Geogr.</hi> P. 207, 208.</note> the Low-land is the moſt civill part of the Realme, where Religion is moſt orderly eſtabliſhed;</hi> but the other part called <hi>the Highland, which lyeth further to the North, or bendeth towards Ireland, is more rude and ſavage, and ſo further from conformitie in Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there may be great difference alſo in reſpect of Preachers, and Sermons, wherewith ſome Countries are much better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed then others; and thence are not onely more Civill, but more Religious alſo; for civilitie and religion mutually conduce to the helpe of each other; Civilitie makes men more capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Religion makes them more conformable to Civilitie; this is obſervable in many parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> which are but poorely ſtored with well gifted Preachers, in compariſon of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and many other places of this Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that in the reformed Churches, as in the Churches of <hi>France, Germany, Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be <hi>leſſe ſtrict and pious, more licentious and ſcandalous then in England, where there hath beene powerfull preaching, without the practiſe of excommunication, and ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament.</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:113330:38"/>It is to be conſidered that in <hi>England</hi> both ſuſpenſion from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and excommuication have beene in uſe, before the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Prelates and Service Book; and by this Argument we might plead for the retaining of the <hi>Engliſh Prelacie</hi> and <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> and againſt the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Preſbytery</hi> and <hi>Directory,</hi> both which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Priune</hi> hath in a better opinion and reputation, then the Government and Book which were their predeceſſors in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; and if we ſuppoſe there is powerfull preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the one Government, and not with the other, we ſhould aſcribe the prelation to that which is principall and preſent, <hi>viz.</hi> the preaching of the word, and not caſt a reproach upon that which is acceſſory (though in a ſecondary degree neceſſary alſo) becauſe it is abſent, ſince the <hi>want</hi> thereof can contribute nothing to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall proficiencie, but the <hi>preſence</hi> and exerciſe of it, very much.</p>

                  <hi>In this very thing lies the very knot of the Controverſie, betweene theſe who are for the Preſbyteriall, and thoſe who are for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall way, in reference to the matter in hand, namely the meanes to reducing from, or keeping out errours and hereſies from the Church, in this lies the dividing buſineſſe: But I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider at what a punctum we divide here, and judge whether the cauſe of diviſion in this thing be ſo great, as there can be no helpe; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if an evill ſpirit prevaile not amongſt us, we may not joyne; For,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, conſider, what is there in this delivering to Satan? which is a ſeventh thing which our Brethren thinke may hopefully prevaile with mens conſciences, when the ſixe former cannot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes, ſay they, for by this they are put out of the Kingdome of Chriſt, into the kingdome of Satan, and this will terrifie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This putting out of Chriſts Kingdome, muſt be underſtood</hi> clave non errante; <hi>if the Synod judges right, not otherwiſe; yes, this is granted by all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then conſider whether this be not done before, and that with an authoritie of Chriſt, by thoſe former ſixe things; for bereticall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, or perſons, are judged and declared in a ſolemne Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by the officers of Chriſt, gathered together in his Name, to be ſuch as have no right to any Church Ordinance, to have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with any of the Churches of Chriſt. Now if this judgement be right, are not ſuch perſons, or Congregations put out of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and put under the power of Satan conſequently?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thirdly. If ſome brethren riſe to a ſeventh degree, and others ſtay at ſixe, which have yet ſuch a power over conſcience, that if they prevaile not, the ſeventh is no way likely to prevaile: why ſhould not the Apoſtles rule quiet us all,</hi> Phil. 3.15, 16. <hi>Whereto we have already attained, let us walke by the ſame rule; if in any thing you be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, God will reveale even this unto you; if we have attained
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113330:41"/>but to ſixe, and our Brethren have attained to ſeven, let us walke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovingly to the ſixe; if God ſhall after reveale the ſeventh (we will promiſe to pray and ſtudy in the mean time) we ſhall walke with them in that alſo: why muſt it needs be now urged with violence, ſo as to divide elſe? and although we hold not the ſeventh, yet there is an ingredient in the ſixt, that hath in it the ſtrength of the ſeventh; for wherein lies the ſtrength of the ſeventh above the reſt? is it not in this, that it is the laſt meanes Chriſt hath appointed in his Church to work upon the heart? this conſideration hath much terror it it; Now thoſe in the Congregationall way ſay, that this is fully in the ſixth, wherefore that is as terrible to their conſciences, as the ſeventh can be to the conſciences of our brethren, and that upon the ſame ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ſo, what is the difference (for this matter) more then that which hath beene betwixt many godly and Orthodoxe Divines about the diviſion of the Lords Prayer, whether it containe 6. or 7. petitions, when thoſe that are for ſixe, have as much matter in thoſe ſixe, as thoſe that have ſeven; and thoſe that have ſeven, no more then is contained in the ſixe? for my part, if this be candidly, and cordially in point of Church Government delivered, and ſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and profeſſed by thoſe of his ſide, I hope ſuch as are adverſaries unto both parties, ſhall not long rejoyce, and proſper by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they make of our mutuall diviſions.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Onely we have thought it neceſſary to declare, and make knowne, that the Clauſe in the Directory for the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, which appointeth the Table to be ſo placed, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants may orderly ſit about it, or at it, is not to be interpreted as if in the judgement of our Kirks, it were indifferent for any of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113330:42"/>Communicants not to come to, and receive at the Table, or as if we did approve the diſtributing of the elements by the Miniſter to each Communicant, and not by the Communicants among themſelves, in which particulars we ſtill conceive and beleeve the order and practiſe of our owne Kirke to be moſt agreeable to the word of God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the nature of that heavenly Feaſt and Table; nevertheleſſe in other particulars we have reſolved, and doe agree to doe as you have deſired us in your Letter:</hi> This was part of the Letter from the Generall Aſſembly at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> ſigned thus: <hi>Subſcribed in the name of the Generall Aſſembly by</hi> Mr. Robert Douglas <hi>Moderatour.</hi> Feb. 13. 1644.</p>
               <p>Whereby we ſee they doe not for that difference of opinion take any offence, or ſhew any diſlike of their Brethren at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> nor any diſtaſt at the reſt of the Directory for any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular contained in it.</p>
               <p>But yet for all this ſome are ſo unwilling to beleeve there will be peace, (eſpecially in the point of Government of the Church) that they faine the Parliament and the Aſſembly of Divines at irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliable difference about it, the Divines requiring the ſtampe of Divine right to be ſet upon it, and the Parliament reſolute to yeeld no more authoritie for it, then a meere Civill Sanction can give unto it.</p>

                  <p>To this we anſwer: 1. That the Divines doe not affirme the whole frame and fabrick of Church Government to be of Divine right, for it is made up of particulars of different kinds, <hi>viz. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of Government,</hi> which have their warrant either by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in his word, or direct inference from it, as that there muſt be <hi>Church Officers,</hi> Paſtors, and their Ordination, Elders, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and <hi>Church Offices</hi> both of preaching, adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and Government; <hi>Church cenſures,</hi> admonition, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion, excommunication; and <hi>accidentall,</hi> or <hi>circumſtantiall addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which are of prudentiall direction, and conſideration, as <hi>for Paſtors,</hi> when and in what manner they ſhall be ordained; whether a Preacher ſhould treat on a Text, or on ſome Theologicall Theme or Common place, when and how oft, and to how many at once the Sacraments ſhould be adminiſtred, how many aſſiſting Elders ſhould be in a Pariſh, and whether they ſhould be choſen and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113330:43"/>to their office with impoſition of hands, and continue in it for a yeare or two, or for terme of life; in what forme of words admonition, ſuſpenſion, or excommunication ſhould be compriſed and pronounced, with divers others of like ſort.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction the Divines of the Aſſembly make of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Directory for the publique worſhip of God through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the three Kingdomes, (and the ſame hath the like uſe in the Church Government deſired) their words in the laſt leaſe of the Preface of the Directory are theſe: <hi>We have, after earneſt and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent calling upon the Name of God, and after much conſultation, not with fleſh and blood, but with the holy Word, reſolved to lay aſide the former Leiturgy, with the many rites and Ceremonies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly uſed in the worſhip of God: and have agreed upon this following Directory for all the parts of publique worſhip, at ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary times.</hi>

That though there were much uſe made of the diſtinction of the <hi>key of order,</hi> and the <hi>key of power,</hi> or of Iuriſdiction in the time of the Prelates, ſo that they confined that wholly to the Clergie, principally to themſelves, while they ſold, or truſted out the key of power, or of juriſdiction to <hi>Vicars generall, Chancellours, Archdeacons, Commiſſaries,</hi> and <hi>rurall Deanes:</hi> yet is Ordination one of the principall parts of the Presbyteriall power; and if it be (as it is commonly taken) matter of power, to let into the Church by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, as indeed it is; and whom to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, and whom to keep back from participation of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, it is a degree of power farre above both, whom to ordaine to, or whom to debarre from the order of Presbyters: for,</p>

               <p>So haply may ſome conceive, who know no more of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they are told by the <hi>Moderate Intelligencer,</hi> or by his Plagiatie the writer of <hi>the continuation of eſpeciall and remarkable Paſſages,</hi> (who repeats his lying and ſcandalous Relation, word for word) in theſe termes: <hi>This day the Common Councell did preſent a Petition to the Commons Houſe of Parliament, by divers Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and others of that Councell, which ſeemed to complaine, or take ill the proceedings of the Parliament with the Aſſembly, in the late buſineſſe paſt concerning the election of Elders, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Commons ſate long about the buſineſſe, and laid it much to heart, that any ſuch thing ſhould come from the Citie, and that they ſhould lend an eare to any, that ſhould in ſo evill a way repreſent things unto them; and of what dangerous conſequence it was, and gave them an anſwer to this effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they did perceive that they had beene informed; and that they could not but lay it much to heart, that they, who had ever beene ſo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:113330:45"/>ready to doe all good offices for the Kingdome, and goe with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſhould from any, but the Parliament, take a repreſentation of their proceedings; and intreated them, that herealter they would take ſatisfaction from themſelves: Its true they did beleeve they meant well, and had a good meaning, and intention in it, but they were abuſed. They had no ſooner given anſwer to this, but there came another from the Clergy, to the ſame effect, which was more ſad then the former, for they conceived this latter was an appeale from the Houſes to the people, and of as dangerous a conſequence as could be imagined; and that it deſerved a high cenſure: and withall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, if that was the way intended, they would goe on with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and quickly undeceive the people; and in the interim they referred it to the Committee of examinations, that the firſt contrivers, and after fomenters of this buſineſſe, may be dealt with according to merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a parcell of their weekly report, but principally his, who miſcals himſelfe the <hi>Moderate Intelligencer,</hi> for he is neither <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent,</hi> writing what he underſtands not, nor <hi>Moderate,</hi> being paſſionately addicted to a partie, to flatter, either out of an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous ſancie, fondly ſet upon irregular novelties in opinion, and practice, or out of a covetous affection to the wages of iniquitie, the reward of flatterie or ſlander, as the bad cauſe, whereto he hath engaged his Pen, hath need to be ſerved with the one or the other, and in the latter he hath ſhewed himſelfe this laſt weeke, a very <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Among whom there are many, who taken ſingle by themſelves, might in good manners have been entertained with termes which ſavour more of reverence, then of contempt; but this three-far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing News-monger takes upon him, as if he had beene authoriſed by the Parliament, to involve all the venerable Magiſtrates, and prime men of power, and truſt, in this Honourable Citie, and a very great number of the moſt learned, laborious, and conſciencious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Province of <hi>London,</hi> in an unfaithfull and undutifull
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113330:45"/>aſſociation againſt the Parliament, for their joynt petitioning to the Parliament. And where lyeth the crime, that may make them ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſo loud a clamour? was it for petitioning <hi>in generall,</hi> or for their petitioning <hi>in particular?</hi>

But your zeale perhaps (ſuch a zeale as the Apoſtle taxeth, which <hi>is without knowledge,</hi> Rom. 10.2. juſt like a <hi>preſſing-iron</hi> which hath heat without light) ſtirred you up to complaine of ſome troubleſome ſpirits, who, <hi>while the Army is labouring to end ſtrife, begin it anew;</hi> and they are ſuch (ſay you) as <hi>Fame ſaith have been the cauſes of all the ſtrife;</hi> and who be they?

               <p>Fame ſaith, that ſuch factious journeymen as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>D.</hi> are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Incendiaries, and Trumpeters of Sedition, by taking all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, making uſe of all advantages, caſting about for all manner of devices, to increaſe their divided partie, that they may be able to uphold a faction; and becauſe they cannot hope that their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie and paucitie ſhould be able to maintaine a publique conteſt againſt ſo many both perſons and Churches, as are engaged againſt their way, they make it their Maſter-piece, to leaven the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Societies, Cities, Sea-Townes, Armies, but eſpecially the Parliament, with their Independent Principles, and practices; and either to get Independents into places of chiefe power and truſt, or to ſeduce ſuch as are eminent in dignitie, endowments, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to their ſide; and if they cannot obtaine them, they plot how to diſplace them; and if they cannot doe that, to render them leſſe ſerviceable to the Publique, their way is to weaken their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with reproaches, or cunningly to intimate ſome matter of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition touching their acts, or intentions; if they be of ſuch inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie as is of impregnable proofe againſt their obloquie, then they will, by way of compliance, worke out of them what they can, which may conduce to their deſigne; and if they can prevaile no further, they will at leaſt by an artificiall ſweetneſſe of behaviour, by appearances of more then ordinary piety, by a pretended exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of difference of opinion, and practice, and by ſuch inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo becalme or becharme the ſpirits of ſome Presbyterians of eminent parts, as to make them, if not favourable to their cauſe, yet ſo that they may not appeare againſt them when they ſhould, or but in a very remiſſe and moderate degree of oppoſition. Laſtly, (to returne to our <hi>Intelligencer</hi>) they ſet up weekly Pamphleters, who are wholly of their ſtampe, or fee them, or by ſome other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices worke upon them, to take all occaſions to magnifie their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to vilifie and calumniate thoſe that oppoſe them; and ſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:113330:46"/>they ſometimes hyperbolize <hi>a Shrub</hi> on that ſide into <hi>a Cedar,</hi> and diſparage thoſe, who under God are the chiefe pillars, and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the publique welfare, as if they were of no more worth, or uſe, then Reeds ſhaken with the wind; and this is not the leaſt part of the Independent policy, to drive on their deſigne all over the Kingdome; for moſt of the common people know little of the progreſſe of publique affaires, but by ſuch <hi>Informers,</hi> and they furniſh them with weekly lies, to honour thoſe of their owne ſect, or ſects rather, (for they are many) and to caſt reproaches on ſuch as are ſerious, and reſolute in all juſt, and lawfull meanes of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of truth, and reſtoring of peace.</p>
               <p>But it may be he meaneth by <hi>Fame,</hi> that report which he and his fellowes in looſe ſheets have diſperſed abroad in City, and Countrey; and if ſo, I ſay, <hi>Famaeſt malum,</hi> his <hi>fame is infamous;</hi> notoriouſly falſe, as he applyeth it, <hi>viz.</hi> to thoſe who make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Parliament by way of Petition. <hi>We did intreat</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the laſt weeke they would let the Parliament alone, and wait, and no doubt they would ſee a good iſſue, and good content.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We did intreat them to let the Parliament alone?</hi> We Sir, who beſides your ſelfe? and why you? and what meane you by letting the Parliament alone? doe you forbid the ſubject of <hi>England</hi> to petition the Parliament? if that be your meaning (as a man of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Intelligence</hi> may eaſily perceive it is) do you not mean they ſhould be deprived of the moſt undoubted Priviledge, and Libertie, which by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Nations,</hi> is allowed all over the world? if the Parliament had beene of that mind, ſince their firſt Seſſion, they would not have tendred ſo many Petitions to the King, nor have received ſo many Petitions from all parts of the Kingdome; nor could they (but by the informations received in them) have knowne ſo much of the diſtemper of ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor had ſo juſt grounds and cauſes as they had, for many of their <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which were iſſued out from that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Senate: and your ſelfe ſay in the next page, that a part of the Parliaments Anſwer to the Citie Petition was, that <hi>the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were intreated hereafter that they would take ſatisfaction from themſelves,</hi> that is, ſatisfaction of their doubts, and deſires by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate recourſe to that Honourable Court; and how can that be better, or more acceptably done, then by way of petition?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:113330:47"/>But he ſaith, <hi>They need not feare, they may be kept a while from their deſires, but in the end they will have content, if their own earneſt preſſing for it, doe not hinder.</hi> How knowes he that better then they, who have put up their deſires for expediting the difficulties of the Government, by way of petition to the Parliament? The truth is, if he beleeve what he writes, it is but as the Devill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves there is a God, with a very ill will, and if he do not <hi>tremble</hi> at it, he is <hi>afraid</hi> of it; and he would have the Orthodox party but ſo to beleeve it too, as to make them neglect the beſt meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it; for it hath been another piece of ſubtilty of theſe <hi>ſonnes of Zerviah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3, 39. to delay reſolution againſt their way, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that there is no need of ſpeed in it, or no fit ſeaſon or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for it, that their oppoſites may ſecurely ſleep, or ſlacken their endevours, while they with intentive vigilance, and double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, worke on their owne webbe towards the period they have projected; and give them but time to proſecute their cauſe, and they that ſay now wee need not feare, will ſay at length perhaps, wee may not hope to enjoy our deſires; and it may be they will endevour to

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:113330:48"/>our ſelves much obliged both to the Right Honourable the ſaid Lord Maior, and this Honourable Court, for all their loving reſpects unto us in this matter, ſo much laid to heart by them) did humbly preſent both our deſires, and the reaſons thereof:</hi> Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are the ſame which are compriſed in their Petition, which in its proper place will offer it ſelfe to the Reader. The <hi>Reaſons</hi> I thinke it fit to forbeare, for divers reaſons, whereof that which I ſhall mention in the third particular may be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is the <hi>Contents,</hi> which conſiſted chiefly of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and reaſons for the eſtabliſhment of the Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; wherein, though the penning of each Petition was divers in ſtyle, and forme of words, yet as I know for the one, which I ſaw, ſo I beleeve of the other, which I ſaw not, that there was nothing in it, which they thought would be offenſive to either Houſe of Parliament.</p>
               <p>This traducing Intelligencer ſaith, <hi>the Citie Petition ſeemed to complaine, and take ill the proceedings of the Parliament with the Aſſembly, in the late buſineſſe paſt concerning the election of Elders.</hi> But they did but <hi>ſeeme</hi> ſo, and to ſuch perhaps onely, as were not acquainted how carefull they were (who were compoſers or peruſers of the Petition) to ſhunne any expreſſion, that might be juſtly lyable to the exception of the chiefe Sages of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>For the third particular, they <hi>conſented</hi> to exhibite the ſame Schedule of Reaſons, (being in number twelve) that were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Miniſters to the Honourable Court of Common Councell; which, becauſe they were pleaſed to owne, I will not preſume to make publique, without their conſent; yet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I may note (to their great commendation, and for their juſt vindication from the imputation of Schiſme, which hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully charged upon the Citizens of <hi>London</hi>) which was ſuch, that, as I have heard from ſuch as I dare beleeve, the Petition being read in the Common Councell, paſſed with a <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> not one man giving a negative vote againſt it; which is an aſſured argument of the ſoundneſſe of the Aldermen, and Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, (the moſt Honourable, and conſiderable part of the Citizens) and of their clearneſſe from the taint of hereticall, and ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Tenets; and this union was well obſerved as a confutation of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113330:48"/>their reports, who had gloried in a pretended generall oppoſition to the Presbyteriall Government in this Citie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is the <hi>preſenting</hi> of theſe Petitions, which was done at the Houſe of Commons, (upon Wedneſday the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>November</hi>) to whom the Citie Petition was firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a competent number of Aldermen, and of the Common Councell, and afterwards the Petition of the Miniſters by many of them; and on the twentieth day was each Petition preſented to the Houſe of Peeres, in like manner as the day before to the Houſe of Commons.</p>

               <p>Having anſwered the former words, I will now ſpeake onely to the latter: But firſt I muſt pauſe and wonder a while at this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Slander. How Sir, <hi>Was that Petition of as dangerous a conſequence as could be imagined?</hi> no ſuch matter Sir. For what danger at all can be imagined in it, when all is in effect no more but this, <hi>that the Citizens and Miniſters upon Petition may clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the mind of the Parliament, and may be throughly enabled to put in execution their commands, to obey them to the full according
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:113330:53"/>to their engagement in the ſolemne Covenant.</hi> Such fearefull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, even of dangerous conſequence, (if they be reall, not fained) may proceed from the ſelfe-love of your party, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the common felicitie to your owne particular Intereſts; and thinke the world will be in a very ill condition, if the Presbytery ſhould be ſet up, and ſhould ſet bounds to your ambitious, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous encroachments upon the rights of Miniſters and people: and it may be (becauſe you are no <hi>Ionaſſes,</hi> to be willing to be caſt into the Sea to ſave the Ship and paſſengers in it) you may have in your thoughts ſome Military commotion of your owne making; for you know, or may know, that bloody words, lyable to ſuch a ſence, and tending to the like effect, have beene more then once laid to the charge of ſome of your ſide, as hath beene noted, <hi>pag.</hi> 76.</p>
               <p>And if your <hi>dangerous conſequence</hi> be but a fiction and pretence, (which I rather imagine) it muſt be ſuppoſed to be but a caſt of your ſubtilty, to make the ſimple afraid of, and to beget a miſtruſt of ſome dangerous deſigne in the Miniſters, that they may deſert them, and adhere unto you, as men of prudent inſight into immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent miſchieves, and of provident forecaſt to ſecure them from danger who betake themſelves to your cauſe and complices for ſuccour and ſafety.</p>
               <p>Which of theſe conjectures is true, (or whether any other, any worſe, for a plaine Presbyterian is too ſhallow to ſound the depth of a projecting Independent) I will not determine; but I will confidently reſolve, <hi>that</hi> ſuch an imagination of tranſcendent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the Petition of the Miniſters, was no part of the mind of the major part of the Houſe of Commons; (which muſt give deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the whole) for they can never be ſo much miſtaken, as to put ſuch an exuberant expreſſion of offence upon ſo inoffenſive a Petition; who very well know, and cannot but as well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, your Brother <hi>Lilburnes</hi> buſineſſe, and what ſeditious papers he, and his faction ſent abroad; which if you had forgotten (for I doubt not but ſuch a ſchiſmaticall polypragm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:113330:53"/>[<hi>of as dangerous conſequence as may be imagined</hi>] but that I thinke them fitter to be burned by the common Hangman, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in everlaſting oblivion, then now to be mentioned, eſpecially in a Diſcourſe of defence of the Innocent. And truly Sir next unto <hi>Lilburnes</hi> Libels, we may ſay of your malevolent Intelligence of this weeke, that it is <hi>a matter of as dangerous conſequence as may be imagined:</hi> For doo not you, as farre as your credit will carry a miſchievous ſuggeſtion, diſperſe all about a ſuſpition of the Cities and Miniſters combination againſt the two Houſes of Parliament? who have hitherto with honour and ſafetie very much confided in their affection, and fidelitie, (as I doubt not they will ever have cauſe ſo to doe) though ſuch malignant medlers as you ſay and doe what they can to the contrary.</p>

               <p>The other ſecuritie we have is both from the Parliament, and our ſelves, as we have profeſſed before, and in confidence of both, neither Parliamentary Examinations, Declarations, no nor Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall trouble us; for if we be guilty, let them <hi>viſit our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with the rod, and our iniquitie with ſtripes,</hi> Pſal. 89.32. and (if we deſerve it) let them chaſtiſe us not onely with <hi>Solomons whips,</hi> but with <hi>Reboboams ſcorpions,</hi> 1 King. 12.14.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:113330:57"/>command and government, but would breake in pieces into petty parties, as it is upon a rout made by the enemy, and ſo would be of little uſe, or force, either for conflict, or conqueſt, much leſſe would it be terrible as <hi>an armie with banners</hi> ſhould be, and the Church is compared to ſuch an Army, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.4.</p>
               <p>This onely by the way: But he meanes it perhaps an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Army <hi>materially</hi> (not <hi>formally</hi>) as conſiſting of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and common ſouldiers, addicted to Independencie: If he take Independents as diſtinguiſhed from the Orthodoxe party on the one ſide, and from the heterodoxe party of <hi>Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, Antinomians,</hi> and other ſuch erroneous dogmatiſts on the other ſide, (with whom if they be true to the Principles of Religion they cannot finally cloſe in accord againſt the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians) they are much too few to denominate the Army; and I doubt not but the ingenuous, and conſciencious Independents will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that there have beene ſince our wofull warre begunne, and yet are many both skilfull, faithfull, and couragious Commanders, and common ſouldiers, who have done very great and ſucceſſefull ſervice towards the finiſhing of the warre, and yet never came under the name or notion of Independents, unleſſe by miſtake, or impoſture, as this fellow would couſen the Kingdome, and afright the Presbyterians with a conceit of the puiſſance and prevalence of Independencie in the Army, and by the Army, as if that were the life-blood that maintained the ſpirits of our Military forces, and made all the ſouldiers valorous and victorious, and ſo the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Army as Independent, <hi>reduplicative</hi> (for ſo he would have his Reader deluded) had reduced the Kingdome, and brought the warre ſo neere an end; here an end of his Queſtion.</p>
               <p>His Anſwer is, <hi>They,</hi> that is, they that goe about to diſparage Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the Independent Army, <hi>are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, and uncharitable, and either very envious, or ill affected; either they know not what that Party have done for us, or elſe envy that they have done ſo much:</hi> For Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> his detractors I know none ſuch, therefore I know none who therein is unchriſtian, and uncharitable towards him. For your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Army, it is (as Schollers uſe to terme ſuch an unſutable conjunction) a <hi>Bull,</hi> a meere contradiction in <hi>adjecto,</hi> there is no ſuch thing. It may be if you ſhould paſſe uncontrould with ſuch

               <hi>Were it not to ſerve the Parliament?</hi> For your ſervice to the Parliament, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Brit.</hi> I would not have you to be confident either in your owne performances, or of their acceptance, or of the good effects it hath brought forth among the people of the Kingdome; there are ſome, who (though they doe not bragge of wit as you doe) have a great deale more wiſdome then you have, and they ſay, you have begotten much malignitie in many againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and confirmed it in others, and have much weakened the hands of their moſt conſcionable friends, by the licentious extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangancie of your Pen beyond all bounds of grace, or modeſty; and they further adde, (which honeſt men will lay hold on as a promiſe, but you perhaps will take as a threatning) that they will trace your irregular ſteps from the firſt page of your firſt Pamphlet, to this preſent of the number 945. and repreſent you ſo in one entire deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation, and diſcovery, as (if you be not a man of impenetrable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence) will make you aſhamed of your owne reſemblance.</p>
            <p>And for your particular ſervice you pretend to doe unto the Parliament, in abuſing the Petitioners. I beleeve they will have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cauſe to give you thanks, much leſſe any reall reward for your painer; ſince it will ſcarce lye in your power to doe them a greater diſhonour, then to make good men beleeve, and Malignants inſult, that their moſt potent, and beneficent, I may ſay munificent Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:113330:60"/>the Citizens, and their moſt faithfull (and not altogether impotent or unuſefull ſervants) the Miniſters of the Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> either give, or take ſuch offence at each other, as may tend to a rupture; but the hope is there will be preſent helpe, and an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Antidote againſt this ſcandall, in the <hi>Apologeticall Narrative</hi> of the Petitions, as now it is preſented to publique view; which will be the more expedite and prevalent in its operation, by the little credit you have with all ſuch as read your papers as the dictates of a Poet, not of an Hiſtorian; and you are like Sir to have leſſe credit hereafter, and to doe the Parliament leſſe ſervice then you have done (if ever you did any worthy acceptance) becauſe you profeſſe you <hi>will in all things comply with their proceedings:</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. No body will beleeve you will be ſo regular in you writing, as they are in their Parliamentary paſſages.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When you ſay, you <hi>will in all things comply with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi> you muſt either ſuppoſe <hi>that they cannot erre</hi> (which is farre from their thoughts, for they know it is a pitifull, and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ignorance, or perverſeneſſe, not to acknowledge their huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.20. and that it is the preſumption of the Papall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, not a Priviledge of Parliament, to aſſume an infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in their determinations) or <hi>that they may erre,</hi> and then we muſt think, that though they doe ſo, you reſolve to be on their ſide, be it right or wrong; if ſo, doe you not tell the world that your complyance with them, hath more of policy in it, then of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? and will it not readily follow, that ſuch a <hi>Mercurius</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> would eaſily turne to an <hi>Aulicus</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> if (which God forbid) the Royall Prerogative ſhould ſo farre advance, as to plunder the Parliament of their ancient and Honourable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p>The other Animadverſion upon <hi>Britanicus</hi> this weeke concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>the vilifying of the Petitioners,</hi> whom <hi>Lucian</hi> like he fals upon in this ſcornfull and jeering manner: <hi>It is a fine humour in any to cry, We will have this, we will have that done, Come let's petition,</hi> he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>we would have this or that done;</hi> for <hi>we will have this or that done</hi> are termes rather of the <hi>Imperative,</hi> then the <hi>Optative</hi> Mood, fitter for Commanders, then Petitioners. Beſides
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:113330:61"/>Sir, you know there be a ſort of men, who have taken upon them, without petitioning to the Parliament, or Authoritie from the Parliament, to ſet up a Government of themſelves; which the Petitioners dare not attempt without warrant from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this is a <hi>humour</hi> indeed, a <hi>fine humour</hi> of a new impreſſion; but when did you beſtow a jeere or a taunt upon them? in this ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you bewray your partialitie, and ſomewhat worſe which you may heare of hereafter; but ſay on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes I warrant you we are wiſe Stateſmen, know the due times and ſeaſons well enough, and though we lye under the decke, are able to diſcerne as well as they that ſit at the ſterne.</hi> Did the Petitioners take upon them to be Stateſmen? did they not profeſſedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime ſo vaine a conceit, when in a modeſt and humble way they came to the Parliament, as to Stateſmen, the Fathers and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of the State, to receive from their prudent reſolutions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remedies againſt the maladies wherewith the Citie is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly infected, and infeſted? and was it not time to complain, when they perceived the ſubtle inſinuations of Schiſme creepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their families, and found it had ſtolne their wives from their boſomes, their children and ſervants from Oeconomicall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in their families, and from hearing Orthodoxe Divines in the publique Churches of the Citie, to ſort themſelves under erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and hereticall Teachers in private Conventicles?</p>
            <p>And whereas you would degrade the Petitioners <hi>ſitting at the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cke,</hi> though you (for feare or ſhame) may have occaſion to play leaſt in ſight, and to lurke under the hatches to ſecure your ſelfe, the Petitioners are (for the chiefe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t of them) eminently conſpicuous; divers of the one ſort ſit upon the Tribunall of Authoritie, and all of the other weekly appeare viſible to common view in their Pulpits; and have ſo much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ground for diſcovery of the evils of the times, and places they live in, that it can be no diſparagement to the Parliaments pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in many particulars to receive informations from them.</p>
            <p>But they goe beyond their bounds, as <hi>Britanicus</hi> chargeth them, for <hi>their duty leads them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Now he takes upon him to play the Caſuiſt, and to reſolve both poſitively, and negatively, how farre men may proceed to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how farre not; they may (ſaith he) <hi>preſent matter of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in things already eſtabliſhed, not demand the eſtabliſhment of any new thing:</hi> This Aphoriſme is framed of purpoſe for the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe of the Prelacy, and againſt the ſetting up of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, that <hi>Independencie</hi> (and under that Title all Sects of what ſort ſoever) may be ſet up, and ſpread abroad without reſtraint; but a man would think it more reaſonable, that when things are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, they ſhould command either aſſent or ſilence, but in the want of neceſſary things, the preſenting of requeſts for ſupply to thoſe that are able to grant them, hath no affinitie with a fault, but rather hath the nature of a dutie, and therefore they who petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Parliament for Ordination of Miniſters in a new way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Biſhops, (new to this State, though moſt ancient in the Church of Chriſt) were never blamed, but approved by the Parliament, and accordingly an Ordinance paſſed both the Honourable Houſes, for enabling a certaine number of Divines to put it in practiſe; much more cauſe is there to approve the Petitioners, who received a command for the choice of Church Governours, whereto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further direction, and warrant, they could not performe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat obedience as they deſired.</p>
            <p>And for that he ſaith of <hi>leaving all to the Parliament,</hi> in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their univerſall care, <hi>neglecting nothing which may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and convenient,</hi> it hath a pretence of reſpect to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the drift of it is to make all thoſe (who deſire a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of dangerous confuſion, by a ſetting up, and ſettling a regular Government) remiſſe in their mediation for it, while In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents intentively beſtirre themſelves in ſeverall Counties to make choice of ſuch for Knights and Burgeſſes, as favour their faction, and quicken their Patrons with unceſſant importunitie to expedite their deſigne in Parliament, in Committees, in the Army; and ſome of them are ſuch <hi>ubiquitaries,</hi> within the Kingdome, and without, (to worke themſelves up to a capitulating partie) that none but that great Peripatetick, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. goeth beyond them
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113330:62"/>for ſedulitie in proſecution of a plot. And yet whatſoever he aimeth at in this diverſion or prohibition of Petitions, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may have need of them and may make good uſe of them, (yea and as ſome Antipresbyterians bragge,

            <p>For inſtance, having a purpoſe to ordaine the Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which (as the

            <p>This may ſuffice for the ſecond Edition of this ſcandalous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely againſt the Petitions, and Petitioners of <hi>London;</hi> for whoſe ſakes (they being ſo many in number, and ſo eminent in ranke, and order,) and for the good Cauſe wherein they, and many more are ſo much engaged, I have taken the opportunity that was caſt in my way to make this Apologie, otherwiſe I ſhould not think it meete to beſtow my moſt idle minutes upon ſo meane an imployment, as a conflict, or conteſtation with ſuch Antagoniſts as now I have anſwered. Who if they appeare againe with any degree of folly, or offence in this Cauſe, above that which diſcretion may diſdaine, or Religion muſt pardon, though I be ſilent (which yet I doe not promiſe) there will be a courſe taken to make ſome more ſenſible of their unſufferable exceſſes, and others more circumſpect, and cautelous, then to runne the hazard of their deſerved reward.</p>
